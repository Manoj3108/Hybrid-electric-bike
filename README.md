 Design, Fabrication and Analysis of Solar and Wind Hybrid Electric Bike

# SCOPE OF PROJECT WORK
➢ More than 80% of the world’s sale for gasoline motorcycle is connected in the
Asian region.
➢ In the modern days, the primary concern of government is to find out a way by
which we can minimize consumption of fossil fuel and promote the use of
electric vehicle in our daily life.
➢ They will be producing air pollution caused by gas exhaust from motorcycle
has come a serious problem.
➢ Recent petrol price has hit the people hard economically.
Based on the literature survey in the previous section, there is a demand for a design
and fabrication of an Electric Bike which is capable of delivering High Speeds and
moderate load carrying capacity and charged with renewable source of energy like
Solar or Wind energy.


# OBJECTIVE:
Following are the objectives defined in the project
1. To understand the design concepts of electric bikes
2. To design the complete electric bike as per the standards available.
3. Selection of battery to deliver the power and speed to take a moderate load.
4. Fabrication of electric bike and testing the fabricated bike at various conditions.
5. Setting up of a charging point to charge the electric bike using solar energy or
wind energy.

## POSSIBLE OUTCOME
The designed and fabricated Electric Bike may deliver better performance and
economical when compared to the available vehicles in the market.
The objective of a comfortable, compact, high speed and efficient bike can be achieved
by this various experiment results obtained by different authors by advancement in
current E-bike model. This advancement includes the pre-discovered results from
literatures like the selection of materials of frame tubes, aerodynamic design.
➢ The most vital feature of the electric bike is that it does not consume fossil fuels
thereby saving crores of foreign currencies.
➢ The second most important feature is it is pollution free, eco-friendly and
noiseless in operation. For offsetting environmental pollution using of on –
board Electric Bike is the most viable solution.
➢ It can be charged with the help of AC adapter if there is an emergency. The
Operating cost per/km is very less and with the help of solar panel it can lessen
up more
➢ Since it has fewer components, it can be easily dismantled to small components,
thus requiring less maintenance.
FUTURE WORK
➢ The implementation of the project depends upon the amount of time and
resource to do the project in an effective manner.
➢ Alternate source for charging is to be found soon and it also may be
implemented.
➢ Process of increasing the efficiency and power is to be improved and further
steps will be taken
